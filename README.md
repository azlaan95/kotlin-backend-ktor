# kotlin-backend-ktor
A demonstration of how we can use Kotlin as Backed with Ktor

This is a Kotlin Gradle project using Ktor framework to create api.
I am using CIO engine.
Authetication restriction is also used to demonstrate how to we can implement it.
There is no Database connectivity yet but have created a Temp Datastore file which will save the data when pushed in it
